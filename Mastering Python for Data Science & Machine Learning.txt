Step 6: Launching the solution


## Basic Statistics Knowledge:
 
What is Data? Facts, Graphs, Observations, measurement, numbers, information ,quantities
Types Of Data :
Categorical or Qualitative Data > Nominal data & ordinal Data
Numerical or Quantitative Data > Discreate data & Continuous Data

Qualitative/categorical Data
Categorical > Nominal i.e. Pen Pencil Eraser Cow Dog Cat
Ordinal>  Excellent Good  Fantastic Okay 
Numerical or Quantitative Data
Discrete vs Continuous data Are graphs 

# What is Statistics :
Data Such as of Stock market , life sciences, weather, retail, insurance, education
Why statistics are useful in Data Science:
Give a basic understanding of different analyzing methods
Allow Data scientists to use many measure such as the median, the mean, the standard deviation and more.
Population VS Sample:
Population > The entire group that you want to study 
Sample > A specific group that will be used to collect Data (part of the population).

Types Of probability:
Probability Sampling Methods
1. Simple Random Sampling: Every individual has an equal chance of selection, ensuring a representative sample.
2. Systematic Sampling: Selects individuals at regular intervals from a list, starting at a random point.
3. Stratified Sampling: Divides the population into subgroups (strata) and samples from each, ensuring representation across groups.

Non-Probability Sampling Methods
1. Convenience Sampling: Selects individuals based on ease of access, often leading to bias.
2. Purposive (Judgmental) Sampling: Selects individuals based on specific characteristics or expertise.
3. Snowball Sampling: Participants recruit other participants, useful for hard-to-reach populations.

# Statistical Math Functions:
Median > The Middle number in a data set is known as median i.e. 1234567 so 4 is a median in this set.
Mode  > The number that appears the most in a data set i.e. 1233456353896 so 3 is a mode
Mean  > the average of the data set of a numbers we are working with i.e.  adding up all the numbers then dividing by the size of the data. 
Range > The difference between the Max and the Min in a Data set. It allows us to know what is the spread in the Data Example: 2 6 7 8 9 10 12 . Max 12 - Min 2, Range = 10
Quartiles > are values that divide a data set into four equal parts, with each part representing a quarter (25%) of the data.
standard deviation > is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are. It tells us how much the values typically differ from the mean (average). i.e. Consider the data set:
Variance >  is a measure of how much the values in a data set spread out from the mean (average). Itâ€™s calculated as the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean.
decision tree > is a supervised machine learning model that is used for both classification and regression tasks.
Entropy > is a concept from information theory that measures the impurity or randomness in a dataset.
Information Gain > is a metric used in decision trees to decide which feature to split on at each step of building the tree.

Probabilities: 
The measure of likelihood that an event will occur in a random Experiment.
 Used in: Games of chance, Weather prediction, Finances, Mathematics, Any type of prevision.

Type of Events:
Disjoint Event: If two events cannot both happen at the same time. 
Example: The probability that we get one and two simultaneously by rolling one dice.
Non-Disjoint Events: The Two events can have a common outcome. 
Example: Rolling a pair of Dices and having identical numbers.

Type of probabilities: 
Marginal Probability > The probability of an event occurring no matter any other variable. 
Example: The probability of drawing a black card in a deck of cards 
Conditional Probability > The probability of an event occurring when another event has occurred.
Example: Drew a king in a deck of card and that the king is red. 
Joint Probability > Probability that two event occur at the same time. 
Example: Probability of you drew a 1 and a heart in a deck of cards.

Probability distribution It's a Function that describes the likelihood of obtaining a possible value that a random variable can assume based on different criteria. 
Examples: Normal distribution, Binominal distribution, Poisson Distribution, Hyper geometric Distribution, Many others.

## Python
NumPy > (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.
Advantages of Using NumPy:
Speed: NumPy operations are faster than standard Python lists due to its C-based backend.
Efficiency: Memory consumption is lower with NumPy arrays than Python lists.
Extensibility: Supports various scientific and mathematical operations, making it essential for data science and machine learning tasks.
Array oriented computing.
Efficient Multi-dimensional array implementation. 
Created for Scientific computation. 
Faster resolution of operations on entire arrays of Data without writing loops with use of Standardized Mathematical functions. 
Different tools that allow Reading on Array Data on Disk, Writing Array Data on Disk, Working with different memory mapped files. 
Integration of Fourier transform capabilities.
Linear Algebra and random number generation.
Why using NumPy:
Consume less memory
Has an execution speed that is faster than Python list 
Simply convenient to use.
